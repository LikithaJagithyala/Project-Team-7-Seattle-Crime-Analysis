# Seattle-Crime-Analysis by Project Team 7

## Abstract
Crime prediction and prevention have become critical components in urban safety management. With Seattle being one of the leading urban places attracting newer residents due to its IT developments, It becomes quite difficult to understand the safety around this city.  This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to model and forecast crime analysis in Seattle, Washington. Leveraging a rich dataset spanning from 2008, we explore various predictive models to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics of criminal activities. The aim is to develop accurate and reliable predictions that can assist residents to make better choices for their future homes. 
<br><br>
Through the utilization of advanced machine learning algorithms, this project endeavors to provide insights into the temporal and spatial aspects of crime in Seattle. The predictive models are designed to capture complex relationships within the data, enabling the generation of forecasts for future crime occurrences. The results and findings of this study contribute not only to the field of machine learning but also hold practical implications for upcoming city residents seeking data-driven approaches to choose better.

## INTRODUCTION
Residents of urban areas around the world face the constant fear of criminal activities. Seattle, Washington, as a vibrant and dynamic city, is no exception. The rise of technology and the increasing availability of comprehensive datasets have opened new avenues for understanding and combating crime. In this context, machine learning emerges as a powerful tool capable of uncovering patterns, trends, and anomalies within complex datasets, offering valuable insights for crime prediction and analysis.
<br><br>
The objective of this project is to harness the potential of machine learning to analyze and model crime data in Seattle. The dataset, encompassing a range of crime types, geographical locations, and temporal dimensions,combined with census datasets provides a robust foundation for building predictive models. By exploring various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forests, support vector regression, and gradient boosting, we aim to identify the most effective model suitable for our project .
<br><br>
The significance of this study lies in its potential to enhance the resources available for new upcoming residents in Seattle. By developing accurate predictive models, we strive to contribute to proactive crime prevention strategies, resource allocation, and policy decisions. Additionally, the project seeks to advance the broader understanding of the interplay between socio-economic factors like the median income, populations, age etc, along with criminal activities in an urban setting.

In the subsequent sections of this report, we delve into the methodology employed for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. We present the results obtained from each model, discussing their strengths, limitations, and implications. The findings from this project aim to inform evidence-based decision-making, fostering a safer and more secure environment for the residents of Seattle.
